 * #1: There seems to be another IOT Instruction error with this, and 
   according to GDB, it seems like a pthread issue.

LOG #1:
website started on port 3000.
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'
  what():  basic_string::substr: __pos (which is 4) > this->size() (which is 1)
[1]    11627 IOT instruction (core dumped)  ./website

GDB #1:
Thread 9 "website" received signal SIGABRT, Aborted.
[Switching to Thread 0x7fffef7fe6c0 (LWP 11262)]

  - This is related to removing pthread_join, I attempted this myself and fixed
  the string issue, it still does not run correctly and will need to be fixed
  in a later commit.
