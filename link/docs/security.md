Security Policies
=================
We take security in Link very seriously so it is important that if a security
issue has been detected, we will be able to handle the situation as quickly as
possible.

Reporting a Security Issue
--------------------------

### 1. Creating a public issue
The first way you can report a security bug is by creating an issue on GitHub
and explaining the details there, or you can also email the *link-security*
mailing list at [link-security@lists.sr.ht](mailto:~aristonl/link-security@lists.sr.ht).
Email is highly preferred.

### 2. Disclosing the issue privately
You can also report a security issue privately via emailing [Levi Hicks](mailto:me@levicowan.dev)
or direct messaging Levi on Discord (FiRe#9047). Email is preferred if no Discord
servers are shared.
