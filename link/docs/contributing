		Contributing to Link
			or
	How to not make Levi or Ariston go *insane*

=================================================================

This is just a simple little CONTRIBUTING document for Link.
There isn't any need for this document to be fully detailed and
all that since we're more relaxed here since Link is a way
smaller project than Inferno.

1. MAKE SEPARATE COMMITS FOR LOGICALLY SEPARATE CHANGES.

	A good way to test this is to always write descriptions in
	your commits about the technical details (this helps the
	maintainers anyways).

	If your description starts to get long, it should serve
	as a clear sign that probably should be splitting up
	your patch into smaller patches.

2. SIGN YOUR WORK

	We're borrowing using "Signed-off-by" from Linux which
	helps track who exactly did what and who approved a
	change. Although Link is a smaller project, it's just
	general good discipline to follow this.

	The "Signed-off-by" line sits at the end of a commit
	message of the patch which certifies that you have wrote
	the patch.

	To do this, you can just add a line at the end of your
	commit saying:

		Signed-off-by: John Doe <johnd@n11.dev>

	using a known identity (we prefer no anonymous
	contributions). This also can be automatically done for
	you if you use Git by running:

		$ git commit -s

3. CODING STYLE

	The coding style is same across all N11 projects (except
	projects mainly led solely by Ariston Lorenzo). A copy of
	the coding style can be found in the source tree of
	Hydra/Inferno.

4. USE PATCHES

	Although nowadays, people are more accustomed to the
	world of GitHub pull requests, etc., we prefer to use
	patches via email as with other N11 projects. PRs won't
	be able to scale well with our codebases.

	For info on actually working on Link and dealing with
	patches, see docs/patchwork

	Obviously, since most people aren't accustomed to this,
	feel free to use pull requests. But if possible, please
	use patches :^).
